\title{Algorithms for learning Bayesian network classifiers from data.}
\description{
The bnclassify package implements algorithms for learning discrete Bayesian
network classifiers from data. Learning can be performed on both complete and
incomplete data whereas prediction is much slower in the latter case and thus
wrapper learners are not recommended in that case.
