Th results demonstratethm th Mtree indeed extendsth domain of applicability beyond th traditional vector spaces, performs reasonably well inhE[94Kv#E44V[vh data spaces, and scales well in case of growing files. 1 },

  Abstract                 = {We describe an object detection system based on mixtures of multiscale deformable part models. Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL datasets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI-SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function.},

We present the results of a series of tests which indicate that the structure performs well, and conclude that it is useful for current database systems in spatial applications.},

The representation is easy to construct and interpret, yet has formal probabilistic semantics making it suitable for statistical manipulation. We show how we can use the representation to learn new knowledge by combining domain knowledge with statistical data. 1 Introduction Many techniques for learning rely heavily on data. In contrast, the knowledge encoded in expert systems usually comes solely from an expert. In this paper, we examine a knowledge representation, called a Bayesian network, that lets us have the best of both worlds. Namely, the representation allows us to learn new knowledge by combining expert domain knowledge and statistical data. A Bayesian network is a graphical representation of uncertain knowledge that most people find easy to construct and interpret. In addition, the representation has formal probabilistic semantics, making it suitable for statistical manipulation (Howard,...},

  Title                    = {Optimizing Search Engines using Clickthrough Data},
  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an approach to automatically optimizing the retrieval quality of search engines using clickthrough data. Intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. While previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. This makes them difficult and expensive to apply. The goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. Such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. Taking a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. From a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework. Furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. The theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment. It shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming Google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples.},

  Title                    = {Irrelevant Features and the Subset Selection Problem},
  Abstract                 = {We address the problem of finding a subset of features that allows a supervised induction algorithm to induce small high-accuracy concepts. We examine notions of relevance and irrelevance, and show that the definitions used in the machine learning literature do not adequately partition the features into useful categories of relevance. We present definitions for irrelevance and for two degrees of relevance. These definitions improve our understanding of the behavior of previous subset selection algorithms, and help define the subset of features that should be sought. The features selected should depend not only on the features and the target concept, but also on the induction algorithm. We describe a method for feature subset selection using cross-validation that is applicable to any induction algorithm, and discuss experiments conducted with ID3 and C4.5 on artificial and real datasets.},

  Title                    = {Probabilistic Part-of-Speech Tagging Using Decision Trees},
  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a new probabilistic tagging method is presented which avoids problems that Markov Model based taggers face, when they have to estimate transition probabilities from sparse data. In this tagging method, transition probabilities are estimated using a decision tree. Based on this method, a part-of-speech tagger (called TreeTagger) has been implemented which achieves 96.36 % accuracy on Penn-Treebank data which is better than that of a trigram tagger (96.06 %) on the same data. Keywords: Corpus-based NLP, Statistical NLP, Part-of-Speech Tagging. 1 Introduction Word forms are often ambiguous in their part-of-speech (POS). The English word form store for example can be either a noun, a finite verb or an infinitive. In an utterance, this ambiguity is normally resolved by the context of a word: e.g. in the sentence &#034;The 1977 PCs could store two pages of data.&#034;, store can only be an infinitive. The predictability of the part-of-speech from the context is used by automatic part-...},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract. A new and conceptually simple data structure, called a suffix array, for on-line string searches is introduced in this paper. Constructing and querying suffix arrays is reduced to a sort and search paradigm that employs novel algorithms. The main advantage of suffix arrays over suffix trees is that, in practice, they use three to five times less space. From a complexity standpoint, suffix arrays permit on-line string searches of the type, &#034;Is W a substring of A? &#034; to be answered in time O(P + log N), where P is the length of W and N is the length of A, which is competitive with (and in some cases slightly better than) suffix trees. The only drawback is that in those instances where the underlying alphabet is finite and small, suffix trees can be constructed in O (N) time in the worst case, versus O (N log N) time for suffix arrays. However, an augmented algorithm is given that, regardless of the alphabet size, constructs suffix arrays in O (N) expected time, albeit with lesser.space efficiency. It is believed that suffix arrays will prove to be better in practice than suffix trees for many applications.},
